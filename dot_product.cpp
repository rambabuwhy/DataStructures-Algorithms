 * Statement: Maximum Advertisement Revenue
 * Description: You have 𝑛 ads to place on a popular Internet page. For each ad, you know how
 * much is the advertiser willing to pay for one click on this ad. You have set up 𝑛
 * slots on your page and estimated the expected number of clicks per day for each
 * slot. Now, your goal is to distribute the ads among the slots to maximize the total revenue.
 * Task: Given two sequences 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛 (𝑎𝑖 is the profit per click of
 * the 𝑖-th ad) and 𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑛 (𝑏𝑖 is the average number of clicks per day
 * of the 𝑖-th slot), we need to partition them into 𝑛 pairs (𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑗) such that
 * the sum of their products is maximized.
